# MikroTik-Static-Routing
Just like configuring static routing on [Cisco](https://github.com/eightball270/CodingStudio-ComputerNetworkFundamentals?tab=readme-ov-file#static-routing), in MikroTik routers we also have to configure static routing on each router by manually creating a routing table. The configuration of creating a routing table is to enter the destination network address and its gateway.

## Technology Used
- GNS3

## Requirements
1. 12 Client PCs
2. 3 Routers and Swithces (divided 2 VLANs)
3. Straight-Through Cables
4. Crossover Cables (for inter-router connection)

## Configuration Completed
1. VLAN on routers and switches
2. IP address on the router which is used as the gateway for each client PCs and inter-router network
3. Static IP address of each client PCs
4. Static routing configuration via command-line
